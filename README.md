# ActivityTrackerAPI
A Simple Activity Tracker API

- The purpose of this repository is for this to be more of a showcase of all the techniques and know-how I've accumulated over the 9 years of being a developer. That's one of the reasons why you'll see either something that doesn't get used like most of the stored procedures.They've been added as more of a proof that I have knowledge about them.
- I've also got a trello board for all of the changes and things I've encountered (The link to the trello board will be sent through a DM). I wanted to document in the most natural way as possible and since I've worked with Jira, Trello, and other Agile/Scrum software, documenting and cataloguing my tasks as I do them is what comes naturally to me now and what I've found keeps me more focused and on track.
